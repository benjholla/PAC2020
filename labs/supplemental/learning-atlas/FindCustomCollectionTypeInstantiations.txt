Problem Statement: Find all calls within the app to custom collection type constructors.  Define a custom collection type
                   to be a class that inherits from java.util.Collection and is defined within the app (your project).

// create some subgraphs of the CALL, CONTAINS, and SUPERTYPE edges
var containsEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Contains)
var callEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Call)
var supertypeEdges = universe.edgesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Supertype)

// define the app to be everything contained in the project "CustomCollection"
var app = containsEdges.forward(universe.project("CustomCollection"))

// grab a reference to the java.util.Collection class node
var collectionType = typeSelect("java.util", "Collection")

// find all subtypes (children) of java.util.Collection
var allCollectionTypes = supertypeEdges.reverse(collectionType)

// find all subtypes of java.util.Collection that were also defined in the app (not in the Java APIs)
var appCollectionTypes = allCollectionTypes.intersection(app)

// find all the methods, variables, etc declared under the app's custom collection types
var appCollectionDeclarations = containsEdges.forward(appCollectionTypes)

// pick out all the constructor's from the app collection declarations
var appCollectionConstructors = appCollectionDeclarations.nodesTaggedWithAny(XCSG.Constructor)

// find app methods that directly call the app collection constructors and discard constructors that are not called by the app
var appConstructorCalls = callEdges.reverseStep(appCollectionConstructors)

// create a highlighter to color the constructors red
var h = new Highlighter()
h.highlight(appCollectionConstructors, java.awt.Color.RED)

// show the app constructor colors with the constructors colored red
show(appConstructorCalls, h)
