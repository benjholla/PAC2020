# README

Note that in order to complete these labs the Eclipse Android SDK Manager must be installed (it was not installed to save space).

Within Eclipse navigate to Help > Install New Software... and enter the update site: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Install and restart Eclipse.

After Eclipse restarts download the SDK manager and restart again.

Within the SDK manager download Android APIs 15 for ConnectBotBad. You may also want API 16, 17, and 18. Note that only the SDK libraries are needed not the emulators.
